# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This page was built to be a study guide to the Prework assignments for a full stack web development coding bootcamp. I have highlighed some notes on the broad topics that I have touched on for the first time with this page including HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Users may navigate to the site using the URL and reading the notes organized under the topics HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript.

Users may additionally open the Chrome Dev tools panel using CTRL+Shift+I and navigating to the console tab, where by refreshing the page they will see a randomized topic of study suggested.

## Credits

This webpage was built using steps provided by my upcoming bootcamp's course. I was also aided, when stuck, by my friends Google, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.
